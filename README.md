# SpeakIt
Filling forms with speech

Speak It builds audio forms for people with special needs. Speak It uses advance audio algorithms to speak questions and capture and process answeers. 

Speak It is configured through a config.json file which takes the number of questions and time to be provided to the form filler for the questions. 
Form builders can specify the actual questions in questions.question file. Each line is a different question. 

Speak It speaks out the questions one by one and processes the answers of the user. Each answer is converted into a separate text file and stored from where it can be accessed by the form builder.
